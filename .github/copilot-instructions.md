# General Coding Standards

- Implement desired functionality, always use JSDocs and remove unnecessary code/libraries.
- Follow coding styles, standards, and conventions (SOLID, KISS, DRY principles).
- Strive for concise, meaningful code and avoid over-engineering.
- Utilize functional programming concepts, such as immutability and declarative code.
- Comment complex logic or algorithms clearly.
- Use TypeScript for new code and provide clear type definitions.
- Employ ES6+ features, like arrow functions and template literals.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code instead of callbacks or `.then()` chaining.
- Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and use parameterized queries.
- Consider algorithmic complexity, lazy loading, and caching.
- Avoid premature optimization, unnecessary comments and dead code.
