Project Context:

- This is a [Node.js | Python] backend service built with scalable, cloud-native principles.
- Architecture: Distributed microservices communicating via [REST | gRPC | Message Queues].
- Follow clean code, SOLID principles, and error handling best practices.
- All code should be production-grade, testable, and optimized for readability and maintainability.

Copilot Instructions:

- Prioritize writing modular, reusable functions.
- Use appropriate design patterns when relevant (Factory, Strategy, etc.).
- For infrastructure code, prefer declarative IaC (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi).
- Use concise, descriptive variable and function names.
- Write self-documenting code with inline JSDoc or Python docstrings.
- Include edge case handling and default behavior where applicable.
- When writing test files, use [Jest | Pytest | JUnit] and aim for high coverage.
- For DevOps scripts, assume a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
